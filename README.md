# Diffusers Project âš¡ðŸš€

## Overview
This project explores the implementation of diffusers from scratch, using staple diffusion, and implementing various papers on diffusion models. The project also includes a Streamlit app for deployment and visualization of results.

- **staple_diffusion**: Implementation of staple diffusion
- **papers**: Implementation of four papers on diffusion models
  - **deep_unsupervised_learning_using_nonequilibrium_thermodynamics**: Implementation of "Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics" paper
  - **denoising_diffusion**: Implementation of "Denoising Diffusion" paper
  - **high_resolution_image**: Implementation of "High Resolution Image Synthesis using Diffusion Models" paper
  - **diffusion_models_beat_gans_on_image_synthesis**: Implementation of "Diffusion Models Beat GANs on Image Synthesis" paper
- **photos**: Directory containing results pictures
- **app**: Streamlit app for deployment and visualization of results

## Implementation
1. **Diffusers from Scratch**: This Notebook contains an implementation of diffusers from scratch, including the necessary code and explanations.
   
2. **Staple Diffusion**: This directory contains an implementation of staple diffusion, including the necessary code and explanations.
   
3. **Papers**: This directory contains implementations of four papers on diffusion models:
   - "Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics"
   - "Denoising Diffusion"
   - "High Resolution Image Synthesis using Diffusion Models"
   - "Diffusion Models Beat GANs on Image Synthesis"
   Each paper implementation includes the necessary code and explanations.
   
4. **Results Pictures**: This directory contains pictures showcasing the results of the implemented diffusion models. 
   
5. **Streamlit App**: This directory contains a Streamlit app for deployment and visualization of results. The app allows users to interact with the implemented diffusion models and visualize the results.

## Running the App
To run the Streamlit app, navigate to the app directory and run the following command:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
